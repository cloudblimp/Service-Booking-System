# Service-Booking-System
Service Booking System lets customers book home services (e.g., cleaning). Bookings auto-assign a cleaner who visits and completes the service; customers pay through the platform afterwards. An admin dashboard provides real-time tracking of bookings, service status, payments, and cleaner assignments for transparency and operational efficiency.
